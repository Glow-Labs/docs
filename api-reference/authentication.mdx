The string 'Authorization': 'Bearer "token"' typically appears in the context of HTTP requests, particularly in the header part of an API call. This format is used for authentication and authorization purposes. Here's a brief explanation about each component and its role

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer "token"'
```

## API Tokens

Authorization: This is the name of the HTTP header where authentication credentials are provided to access a resource. It's used by the server to determine if a client has permission to access the requested resource.

Bearer: This part of the header indicates that the type of authentication being used is a "Bearer Token." Bearer tokens are a type of access token that allows the bearer (the client making the request) to access a protected resource, like an API. The term "bearer" implies that the possessor of the token has been authorized to access the resource; it doesn't necessarily verify the identity of the user, just the possession of a valid token.

token: This placeholder represents the actual token value provided to the client. This token is a unique string of characters that acts as a credential, used to authenticate and authorize the client making the request to the server. In practice, this would be replaced with a real token value assigned by the server or the service providing the API.

### Permissions

The use of Bearer tokens is a common method for handling API authentication in web and mobile applications. It's part of the OAuth 2.0 framework, which is a standard for authorization. When a client wants to access a protected resource, it must present this token in the HTTP header of its request. The server then validates the token and, if it's valid, allows the request to proceed. If the token is missing, expired, or invalid, the server will deny access to the resource.
